# mini-gis

The idea is to make a simple map feature / geometry editor with:
 * import and export support
 * drawing and editing features
 * a simple REST API for querying/searching the data
 * a style editor
 * a metadata editor
 * support for different projections

Other goals:
 * Test new interesting technologies
